ESPortal Credential Harvester<br>
-----<br>
<br>
A social engineering attack vector.<br>
Redirects HTTP requests to a fake login page. 
Does not support HTTPS requests nor does it override cached HTTPS redirects.<br>
You can define a custom template for up to 3 specific domains, a welcome portal, and a catch-all.<br>
<br>
Example scenario: Setup ESPortalV2 to act as a free WiFi hotspot.<br>
<br>
Captured credentials are stored on the exfiltration page in the file corresponding to the URL.<br>
<br>
Custom html templates can be uploaded for the ESPortal login credential harvester via FTP.<br>
If a custom html template is found it will override the default settings.<br>
Upon deletion the default settings are automatically restored.<br>
<br>
The filenames must match the below exactly in order to apply a template override.<br>
captiveportal.html     -     The catch all that handles the redirects.(Would be rare to override this part)<br>
welcome.html           -     The welcome page for the "free wifi" hotspot.<br>
spoof_other.html       -     The generic login credential harvester for a site not in the list.<br>
spoof_site1.html       -     The 1st login credential harvester site in the list with a custom layout.<br>
spoof_site2.html       -     The 2nd login credential harvester site in the list with a custom layout.<br>
spoof_site3.html       -     The 3rd login credential harvester site in the list with a custom layout.<br>
error.html             -     Display some sort of custom error when the user enters login credentials.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Modifying any ESPortal related setting requires a reboot of the ESPortal device.<br>
Do not leave any line blank or as a duplicate of another.<br>
